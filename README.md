<h1 align="center">What's Cooking with Atlas Search</h1>

<h2 align="center">A Restaurant Finder Application Demo MongoDB Atlas Search</h2>
<p>Hello! ðŸ‘‹ This application allows you to search lightning fast through over 25,000 restaurants in the New York city area based on a variety of search parameters and data types:
<ul>
<li>restaurant name</li>
<li>geolocation coordinates</li>
<li>cuisine type</li>
<li>average star rating</li>
<li>borough</li>
</ul>
<div align="center">

</div>

<p> Atlas Search is powered by Apache Lucene and supports the most popular Atlas Search features from autocomplete to custom scoring. By building out What's Cooking, you'll learn all sorts of ways MongoDB allows you to build complex, fine-grained full-text searches <em>SIMPLY</em> on your Atlas data using Apache Lucene.</p>

**No additional servers or software needed. No need to keep data in sync. Everything is done in MongoDB Atlas.**

- fuzzy matching
- highlighting
- autocomplete
- range queries
- geoqueries
- facets
- relevance-based scoring
- custom function scoring

<p>Check out the video of the MongoDB .Live keynote to see a demonstration of all the features or visit the link below to play around with the finished application, hosted entirely in MongoDB Atlas:</p>
<h2 align="center"><a href="https://www.atlassearchrestaurants.com">www.atlassearchrestaurants.com</a></h2>

<p>This application is hosted entirely by MongoDB Atlas was created using:</p>

- React
- Tailwind CSS
- A modified sample dataset based on MongoDB's Atlas sample_restaurants dataset

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

- A MongoDB Atlas account. Get one for free <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas">here.</a>
- A recent version of Node.js and npm.
- Restaurant sample dataset.
- (Recommended) <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass">MongoDB Compass - GUI</a>

<p>You can read and download the dataset using the MongoDB Shell, any MongoDB driver, or my favorite MonogDB Compass using the following URI:</p>

</p>

<h2>Using Realm as Your Serverless Backend....</h2>
<p>What's Cooking uses HTTP services in Realm to create 2 APIs to allow you to query for your restaurant data over HTTP: </p>

- `getRestaurants` called from the `useHomeFetch.js` hook.
- `getRestaurantsAutocomplete` called from the `Autotsuggestions.js` component.

Find the Realm application in the <code>supplement-files</code> branch in a folder called `WhatsCookingRealm`</p>
